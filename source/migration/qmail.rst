Qmail Migration
###############

On the upcoming Uberspace U8 mail system the deprecated qmail configurations from U6 will no longer be available.

Check your configuration
------------------------

To check now if any of your qmail configurations encounter problems to be used in the standard mail setup, you
can use the migration tool:

.. code-block:: console

 [isabell@stardust ~]$ uberspace migration qmail status

The command will help you to identify any problems in your current configuration. You can see more details with the
check command:

.. code-block:: console

 [isabell@stardust ~]$ uberspace migration qmail check

This command can also be run with ``--verbose`` to output even more details. Run it with ``--help`` for all info
how to use the command.
