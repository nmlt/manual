.. _config-filename-off:

The filename ".qmail-Example" cannot be parsed
==============================================

``id:config-filename-off``

This error indicates that the filename contains special letters or capitalization that might work with Qmail but
could be problematic with the standard mail system.

You should check if the mailaddress is currently in use and if it works as expected. If so you should try to set it up
manually with the `uberspace mail commands <https://manual.uberspace.de/mail-mailboxes/>`_.
