.. _content-unknown:

The file contains unknown content
=================================

``id:content-unknown``

This is the fallback error when we could not detect the type of your qmail file content.

You should check with ``cat ~/.qmail-example`` how the file is currently configured and decide how you want to set it up
with the `uberspace mail commands <https://manual.uberspace.de/mail-mailboxes/>`_.
