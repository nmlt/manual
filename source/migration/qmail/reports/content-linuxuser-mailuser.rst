.. _content-linuxuser-mailuser:

The file contains an internal redirect to a mailuser
====================================================

``id:content-linuxuser-mailuser``

This error indicates, that you have set up an internal redirect to a mailuser without a full mailaddress. We can only
support full mailaddresses as forwards in the standard mail system.

You should set an explicit mailaddress here. Otherwise we will create a forward to the default mail domain
**mailuser@username.uber.space**.
