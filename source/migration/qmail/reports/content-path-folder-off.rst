.. _content-path-folder-off:

The maildir path does not point to ~/users/example
==================================================

``id:content-path-folder-off``

This error indicates that the qmail file contains a path to a maildir which is not a path to the corresponding maildir.

This bypasses the standard mailsetup and you need to check manually how to want to set this up.
